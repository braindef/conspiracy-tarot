echo -e "\e[31mmy printer-firmware seems to hate this cards, even it has no route to the internet. eg if you printed 10 Cards the printer is electrostatically loaded, so the cards stick together you the printer takes 2-5 cards at the same time, so in this case it's the easiest to remove all paper from all trays and put the cards single into the printer

=> in the manual paper tray, edit this file for this problem
=> we also suggest to test it first manually, some printers turn the card, some turn them twice, after that the file for the backside
   of the card opens, in that case you have to choose $(cat ./print.txt|wc -l) copies manually after you have
   put the cards the other direction into the printe
=> after pressing enter, dont touch your computer until the cards are all printed
